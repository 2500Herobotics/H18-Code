This determines the point at which the absolute sensor wraps around, keeping the absolute position in the range [x-1, x).\n\n- Setting this to 1 makes the absolute position unsigned [0, 1)\n- Setting this to 0.5 makes the absolute position signed [-0.5, 0.5)\n- Setting this to 0 makes the absolute position always negative [-1, 0)\n\nMany rotational mechanisms such as arms have a region of motion that is unreachable. This should be set to the center of that region of motion, in non-negative rotations. This affects the position of the device at bootup.","Ordinal":0,"Type":"double","Description":null,"Units":"rotations","MinValue":0,"MaxValue":1,"SignalId":2709,"SignalName":"Config_AbsoluteSensorDiscontinuityPoint","DefaultValue":0.5,"Value":0.5,"EnumValues":[]},{"Name":"Magnet Offset","Summary":"This offset is added to the reported position, allowing the application to trim the zero position.
